            <h3>Stick to a Consistent Sleep Schedule</h3>
            <p>
                Maintaining a regular sleep routine can significantly improve sleep quality.<br> Aim to go to bed and
                wake
                up at the same time every day, including<br> weekends. This consistency helps regulate your body’s
                natural<br>
                sleep-wake cycle.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Develop a Calming Bedtime Routine</h3>
            <p>
                Creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine can signal your body that it’s time to wind down. <br>Consider
                activities such as reading a book, <br>taking a warm bath, or practicing mindfulness meditation. These
                calming practices can<br> prepare your body for a restful night’s sleep.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Optimize Your Sleep Environment</h3>
            <p>

                Transform your bedroom into a sleep-friendly haven: Adjust the temperature: Keep your room cool,<br>
                ideally
                between 60-67°F (15-19°C).
                Minimize disruptions: Use earplugs, white noise machines,<br> or blackout curtains to reduce noise and
                light.
                Invest in comfort: Choose<br> a mattress and pillows that support restful sleep.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Limit Screen Time Before Bed</h3>
            <p> The blue light from screens can interfere with melatonin production,<br> making it harder to fall
                asleep.
                Experts recommend avoiding <br>electronic devices such as phones, tablets, and TVs at least an hour
                before
                bedtime.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Be Mindful of Food and Drink</h3>
            <p> What you eat and drink before bed can affect your sleep:

                Avoid caffeine and large meals: <br>Refrain from consuming caffeine or heavy meals close to bedtime. Try to
                finish eating at<br> least 2-3 hours before you go to sleep.
                Limit alcohol: Although alcohol may help <br>you fall asleep, it can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to
                frequent awakenings.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Incorporate Regular Exercise</h3>
            <p>Regular physical activity can enhance sleep quality, but it’s best to avoid vigorous exercise close to<br>
                bedtime. Aim for regular exercise during the day to help you fall asleep faster and improve overall<br>
                sleep quality.


            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Limit Naps</h3>
            <p>
                If you find yourself needing a nap, keep it short—20-30 minutes—and avoid napping late in the afternoon.<br>
                Late-day naps can interfere with your ability to fall asleep at night.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Exercise Caution with Sleep Aids</h3>
            <p>
                While occasional use of sleep aids might be beneficial, relying on them regularly can lead to<br>
                dependency. It’s better to address the underlying issues affecting your sleep rather than depending on<br>
                medication.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Seek Professional Help if Needed</h3>
            <p>
                Stress and anxiety can significantly impact sleep. Techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle<br>
                relaxation, and mindfulness meditation can help alleviate stress and promote better sleep. Persistent<br>
                sleep issues despite lifestyle changes may require professional evaluation. Consult a<br>
                healthcare provider or sleep specialist if you suspect conditions like sleep apnea, insomnia, or<br>
                restless legs syndrome.

            <h3>Stay Hydrated</h3>
            <p>
                Maintaining hydration throughout the day is important, but try to reduce fluid intake in the evening to<br>
                avoid frequent trips to the bathroom during the night.

            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Reserve Your Bed for Sleep </h3>
        <p>
            Avoid using your bed for activities such as working or watching TV. This helps create a strong<br>
            association between your bed and sleep, reinforcing restful habits.

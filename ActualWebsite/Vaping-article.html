                and
                health professionals With appealing flavors and the misconception that itâ€™s a safer alternative to
                <br>smoking,
                more adolescents are picking up vaping devices. This article delves into the trends, risks,<br> and

            <h3>Teen Vaping on the Rise</h3>
            <p>
                Vaping, which involves inhaling aerosol from electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or other devices,
                has<br>
                become increasingly popular among teenagers. The rise in vaping among youth is attributed to the<br>
                allure
                of various flavors such as fruit, candy, and dessert, coupled with the perception that it is less<br>
                harmful than traditional cigarettes.

            <h3>Health Risks and Concerns</h3>
            <p>Despite its marketing as a safer alternative to smoking, vaping poses serious health risks. Many vape<br>
                products contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and can adversely affect adolescent brain<br>
                development. The aerosol from these devices may also contain harmful substances, including heavy
                <br>metals
                and toxic chemicals, posing potential long-term health issues and impacting lung health.
